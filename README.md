# CCA Tools

**By Mimi Wang and Peihai Zhao**

This is a repository which includes the source codes of CCA Tools. The tools contain a series of algorithms, which are the implement of methods proposed in a research paper by Mimi Wang and Peihai Zhao. The paper is entitled with *A Measure Consistency Method for the Overlapping Correspondence of Workflow Nets Based on a Relation Profile Partner Matrix*.

The tools are developed using python language under version 3.7.7, and run with command-line mode by default. To improve its usability, we add a user interface on it. The GUI demo application is developed using electron framework under electron version 9.1.0, node version 14.5.0, chromium 83.0.4103.122. This demo will be developed in a sustained way, and its current version is 1.0.0.

During developing, we import and use the valuable functions of other python packages. For example, the [PM4PY](https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de) package developed by Berti, Alessandro etc. in Process Mining for Python PM4Py: Bridging the Gap Between Process-and Data Science.

If you are interested in this tool, we welcome you read our papers and follow our further research.
